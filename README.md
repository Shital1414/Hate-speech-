# # Hate Speech Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

[cite_start]This repository documents a project on detecting hate speech in text posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques[cite: 405, 409]. [cite_start]The goal is to build an effective content moderation model to help create safer digital communities[cite: 639].

## üìä Dataset Overview

[cite_start]The analysis was performed on a dataset of 60,444 text posts[cite: 411, 414]. [cite_start]The posts were classified into three categories[cite: 412, 415]:

* [cite_start]**Normal**: 24,449 posts (40.5% of the dataset)[cite: 427, 464, 475].
* [cite_start]**Hate Speech**: 18,070 posts (29.9% of the dataset)[cite: 429, 468].
* [cite_start]**Offensive**: 17,925 posts (29.6% of the dataset)[cite: 430, 471].

[cite_start]Collectively, harmful content (Hate Speech and Offensive) constitutes 59.4% of the dataset[cite: 490, 493].

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

A complete NLP pipeline was implemented to process the text data and train classification models.

### 1. Text Preprocessing

The raw text data was cleaned and normalized through the following steps:
1.  [cite_start]**Text Cleaning**: Removed URLs, user mentions, and special characters[cite: 433, 434].
2.  [cite_start]**Normalization**: Converted all text to lowercase and performed tokenization[cite: 436, 437].
3.  [cite_start]**Feature Preparation**: Removed common stop words and applied lemmatization to reduce words to their root form[cite: 438, 439].

### 2. Feature Engineering

* [cite_start]**TF-IDF Vectorization**: The preprocessed text was transformed into a numerical format using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method[cite: 441, 442, 516].
* [cite_start]**Feature Matrix**: This process resulted in a sparse matrix with a dimensionality of 60,444 documents by 5,000 features[cite: 524, 537, 538].

## ‚öîÔ∏è Model Comparison

[cite_start]Two machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated to find the best-performing model for this classification task: a baseline Naive Bayes model and a tuned Logistic Regression model[cite: 541].

| Metric              | Tuned Logistic Regression | Naive Bayes |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Accuracy** | [cite_start]**85.2%** [cite: 549, 554]    | [cite_start]82.8% [cite: 556, 580]  |
| **Precision (Hate)**| [cite_start]**82.1%** [cite: 555, 577]    | [cite_start]78.9% [cite: 558, 582]  |
| **Recall (Hate)** | [cite_start]**79.3%** [cite: 559, 578]    | [cite_start]76.5% [cite: 561, 587]  |
| **F1-Score** | [cite_start]**80.7%** [cite: 562, 566]    | [cite_start]77.7% [cite: 562, 588]  |

## üèÜ Results and Conclusion

[cite_start]The **Tuned Logistic Regression** model emerged as the champion, demonstrating superior and more balanced performance across all key metrics[cite: 575, 590, 595].

* [cite_start]**Superior Performance**: With an accuracy of 85.2% [cite: 593] and a higher F1-score, the model is highly effective. [cite_start]The model was optimized for peak performance using GridSearchCV[cite: 609].
* [cite_start]**Better Precision**: The model is better at identifying hate speech while minimizing false positives[cite: 605].

[cite_start]This project successfully developed a high-performing hate speech detection model suitable for real-world content moderation applications[cite: 626, 628].

## üöÄ Future Horizons

Future work could focus on enhancing the model's capabilities in several areas:
* [cite_start]**Advanced Models**: Explore state-of-the-art NLP models like transformers for potentially higher accuracy[cite: 632].
* [cite_start]**Multi-language Support**: Extend the model to detect hate speech in multiple languages[cite: 634].
* [cite_start]**Real-time Processing**: Optimize the solution for real-time detection and content filtering[cite: 637]. using NLP and Machine Learning
